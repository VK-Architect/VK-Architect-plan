    <h1>The Plan</h1>

    <p>
      What is the VK Architect plan? 
      Well, it is a plan for my success.
      It is a plan that shows my determination.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, I’m lost because I don’t know what I want to be.
      My matric marks are not enough to support my dream of becoming a pilot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, I am currently on a journey to discover a new path in coding.
      It’s hard because I don’t have a laptop or a PC that would make things easier.
      This is not by choice, but by circumstance.
    </p>

    <p>
      That won’t stop me though.
      I’m currently using my phone to learn web design.
      Web design itself is not that hard, but on a phone it’s extremely hard and requires a lot of patience, because a phone is not the best device for coding,especially <em>Huawei</em>,... at least not for me.

    <h2>Why VK Architect</h2>
    <p>
         Well when I started this journey of coding I was lost, I didn't know what to do and because of my marks. I was even unsure of coding cause my marks weren't good enough for coding as well, but I still went with coding.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         I went for coding, because during my time of doubt I found out that I can be a self-thought web developer, so I said to myself let me try it out and see if I would like it. 
         You know what? I actually do like it even if its  the most irritating thing in my life, since I'm persuing it on a phone… OK, maybe not the most irritating, but it's definitely up there with <em>Clash Royale</em>.

            <h2>The Scaffold </h2>
      <p>
         Although I would like to say I'm doing it all by myself I can't, because no one can do it by themselves and I had help from my trusted Scaffold.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Just how every builder needs a <em>scaffold</em> while building a new building, I also need my <em>Scaffold</em> to help me while I'm still in the building stages of my future.
