      <h1>The Plan</h1>

      <p>
        What is the VK Architect plan?  
        It is a plan for my success, a plan that shows my determination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, I’m lost because I don’t know what I want to be.
        My matric marks are not enough to support my dream of becoming a pilot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of that, I am on a journey to discover a new path through coding.
        It’s hard, especially because I don’t have a laptop or a PC to make things easier.
        This is not by choice, but by circumstance.
      </p>

      <p>
        That won’t stop me, though.
        I’m currently using my phone to learn web design.
        Web design itself isn’t that hard, but doing it on a phone is extremely difficult
        and requires a lot of patience — especially on <em>Huawei</em>, at least for me.

      <h2>Why VK Architect</h2>

      <p>
        When I started this coding journey, I was lost.
        I didn’t know what to do, and because of my marks,
        I was unsure whether coding was even an option for me.
        Still, I decided to go for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I chose coding because I discovered that I could become a
        <em>self-taught</em> web developer.
        I told myself to try it and see whether I would enjoy it.
        And you know what? I actually do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though it can be one of the most irritating things in my life —
        especially since I’m pursuing it on a phone — it’s still something I care about.
        Maybe not more irritating than <em>Clash Royale</em>, but it’s definitely up there.

      <h2>The Scaffold</h2>

      <p>
        Although I would like to say I’m doing everything on my own, I can’t.
        No one builds something meaningful alone, and I’ve had help from my trusted Scaffold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like every builder needs a <em>scaffold</em> while constructing a building,
        I also need my <em>Scaffold</em> while I’m still in the early stages of building my future.
      </p>
