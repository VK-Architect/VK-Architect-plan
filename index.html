    <h1>The Plan</h1>

    <p>
      What is the VK Architect plan? Well, it is a plan for my success.
      It is a plan that shows my determination.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, I’m lost because I don’t know what I want to be.
      My matric marks are not enough to support my dream of becoming a pilot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, I am currently on a journey to discover a new path in coding.
      It’s hard because I don’t have a laptop or a PC that would make things easier.
      This is not by choice, but by circumstance.
    </p>

    <p>
      That won’t stop me.
      I’m using my phone to learn web design.
      It’s extremely hard and requires a lot of patience,
      because a phone is not the best device for coding.

      <h2>Why VK Architect</h2>
      <p>Well when I started this journey of coding I was lost didn't know what to do and because of my marks I was even unsure about coding cause it wasn't good for it as well, but I still went with coding.</p>
      
      <p>I went for coding, because during my time of doubt I found out that I can be a self thought web developer, so I said to myself let me try it out and see if I would like it and I actually do like it even if its currently the most irritating thing in my life since I'm perusing it on a 
        phone...,OK maybe not the most irritating but it's definitely up there with <em>clash royal</em>.</p>
